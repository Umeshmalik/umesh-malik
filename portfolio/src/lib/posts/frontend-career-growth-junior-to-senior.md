In July 2021, I joined BYJU'S as an Associate Software Engineer. Less than five years later, I'm an SDE-2 at Expedia Group. Here's what I learned about career growth — the technical parts, the non-technical parts, and the things I wish someone had told me earlier.

## The Timeline

- **July 2021**: Associate Software Engineer at BYJU'S
- **January 2022**: Performer of the Quarter (6 months in)
- **March 2022**: Promoted to Module Lead (8 months in)
- **April 2023**: Software Engineer at Tekion Corp
- **June 2024**: SDE-2 at Expedia Group

This wasn't a straight line. Each transition taught me different things.

## What Actually Gets You Promoted

### It's Not Just Code Quality

Good code is table stakes. What separates engineers who grow quickly:

1. **Ownership**: Don't wait to be assigned work. See a problem? Propose a solution. At BYJU'S, I noticed our payment validation had edge cases that caused silent failures. I mapped them all out, proposed fixes, and implemented them. That's what led to the Performer of the Quarter recognition.

2. **Impact Awareness**: Connect your work to business outcomes. "I refactored the payment module" is less compelling than "I refactored the payment module, reducing validation errors by 40% and saving approximately $50K/month in failed transaction costs."

3. **Communication**: The ability to explain technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders is a multiplier. When I presented the Vue-to-React migration plan at Expedia, it wasn't about frameworks — it was about developer velocity, hiring pipeline, and time-to-market.

## Technical Skills That Matter at Each Level

### Junior (0-1 years)
- Core JavaScript: closures, promises, event loop, prototypes
- One framework deeply (React, Vue, Svelte)
- CSS layout (Flexbox, Grid)
- Basic Git workflow
- Writing readable code

### Mid-Level (1-3 years)
- TypeScript beyond basics (generics, utility types, type guards)
- Testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Performance awareness (bundle size, render optimization)
- System design basics (state management, data flow)
- Code review skills

### Senior (3-5+ years)
- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Cross-team technical influence
- Mentoring and knowledge sharing
- Production debugging and incident response
- Understanding of backend concerns (APIs, caching, databases)

## Non-Technical Skills Nobody Talks About

### Learn to Write

Clear writing is a superpower. I write:
- **PR descriptions** that explain the "why" so reviewers have context
- **Technical documents** for architecture decisions
- **Incident postmortems** that help the team learn
- **Blog posts** that solidify my own understanding

Every senior engineer I respect is a clear writer.

### Learn to Disagree

Early in my career, I'd agree with senior engineers even when I saw problems. That's not helpful. Learn to disagree respectfully with data:

> "I see the appeal of approach A, but I'm concerned about X. Here's a prototype of approach B that addresses that — what do you think?"

This is different from "I think we should do B instead." One opens a discussion; the other creates conflict.

### Learn to Estimate (Poorly, but Honestly)

Estimation is a skill you develop through being wrong. The key is being honest:

- "I've never done this before, so my estimate has high uncertainty — 3 to 8 days"
- "I've done similar work, I'm fairly confident: 2 days"
- "This depends on the API team's timeline, so I can't estimate the full scope yet"

Managers respect honesty over optimism.

## Mistakes I Made

### Mistake 1: Chasing Breadth Over Depth

In my first year, I tried to learn React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Node, Deno, and GraphQL all at once. I had shallow knowledge of everything and deep knowledge of nothing.

**What worked instead**: Going deep on React + TypeScript for two years, then expanding.

### Mistake 2: Not Asking Questions Early Enough

I'd spend 3 hours stuck on something, then ask a question and get unblocked in 5 minutes. The fear of looking incompetent cost me real productivity.

**Rule of thumb**: If you're stuck for 30 minutes with no progress, ask for help. Prepare your question well (what you tried, what you expected, what happened) — that shows competence, not the opposite.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Soft Skills

I focused entirely on technical skills for my first two years. When I started investing in communication, writing, and presentation skills at Tekion, my career growth accelerated noticeably.

## How to Transition Between Companies

### When to Move

Move when you've stopped learning and your growth has plateaued, not because of a small salary bump. Each of my transitions had a clear reason:

- **BYJU'S to Tekion**: I wanted exposure to a global product, accessibility, and internationalization
- **Tekion to Expedia**: I wanted to work at enterprise scale with more complex frontend architecture

### Interview Preparation

For mid-to-senior frontend roles:

1. **JavaScript fundamentals**: Event loop, closures, `this`, prototypes — they still ask these
2. **System design**: Design a component library, design a real-time dashboard, design a form builder
3. **React deep dive**: Reconciliation, hooks rules, performance optimization, Server Components
4. **Behavioral**: Use the STAR method. Prepare 5-6 stories that cover leadership, conflict, failure, and impact
5. **Take-home or live coding**: Practice building small apps with time constraints

## Advice for Each Stage

### If You're Junior
Focus on one technology stack and go deep. Build projects. Read source code of libraries you use. Write about what you learn — it forces clarity.

### If You're Mid-Level
Start thinking about architecture, not just features. Review others' code proactively. Understand the business context of your work. Begin mentoring juniors — teaching is the fastest way to learn.

### If You're Approaching Senior
Develop your technical writing. Lead a project end-to-end. Build relationships across teams. Have opinions about technical direction and back them with evidence.

## Key Takeaways

- Career growth is more about impact and communication than code quality alone
- Go deep before going broad — specialize first, then expand
- Writing clearly is a career multiplier at every level
- Each company transition should serve a specific learning goal
- Soft skills aren't secondary — they're the difference between "good engineer" and "great engineer"
- Ask for help early, estimate honestly, and own your mistakes
